# VRIF Interaction Component for VR Builder

## Introduction

This add-on allows to use VR Builder together with VR Interaction Framework. A VR Builder process guides the user through the application, while VRIF provides the interactions in the scene.

## Requirements

This add-on requires VR Builder version 2.1.0 or later to work.

It is recommended to disable the built-in XR Interaction Component to use this integration. You can do so in `Project Settings > VR Builder > Settings`.

## Documentation

You can find comprehensive documentation in the [Documentation](/Documentation/vrif-integration-manual.md) folder.
